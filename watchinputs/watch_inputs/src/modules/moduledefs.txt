A module may have the following functions:

/*
  A function called when the module loads.  Only needed for very
    early operations before the main init functions are called.
*/
__attribute__((constructor)) void <functioname>();

/*
  A function called when the module unloads.  Only needed for very late
    operations during the final exit stage.
*/
__attribute__((destructor)) void <functioname>();

/*
  Add this function to your module to perform initialisation operations.
    The main library will call this during the initialisation stage after all
    modules have been loaded.  You should also use a inuse variable to keep
    track of how many times the init function is called.
    You can call other modules' init functions from this function and then register
    callbacks with some of them for example.
*/
int <modulename>_init(void);

/*
  Add this function to your module to perform shutdown operations.
    The main library will call this during the shutdown stage before the
    program exits.  You should only do the real shutdown once the inuse
    variable goes back down to 0.  This function should also be used to
    unregister callbacks with other modules and then call their shutdown
    functions.
*/
void <modulename>_shutdown(void);
