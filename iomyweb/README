-----1.1: About-----------------------------------------------------------------
IOMy is an app that will allow you to list all your devices that are connected
to any Zigbee Netvox smart plugs. You can use this app to switch them on or off,
alter the names of these devices, and view the electricity usage of each device
in Volts, Amps, kiloWatts and kiloWatts/hour.

-----1.2: Prerequisites---------------------------------------------------------
Before you can start using IOMy for the first time you will need to install and
run IOMy WatchInputs. This will create the initial user to login to the app with
and add a new premise or make use of an existing one if one is already
available. Run WatchInputs and follow the prompts to get started.

-----1.3: Startup, switching users and UI elements------------------------------
To use this program, you must register a user in the app database. After a new
user is created, you can enter your username and password access the start page.
Switching between users is easy. Every page has a button (three lines) that when
pressed will bring up the main navigation popup for the app. This button is
located in the top left corner in the header. Also located in the header is the
IOMy logo, which will take the user back to the home page (Premise Overview)
when tapped. Some pages also require an extras menu. This is to the right of the
IOMy logo as a column of dots. What links that are in this menu depend on the
current page.

-----1.4: App Menu--------------------------------------------------------------
The main menu consists of a button with a green background and the current
user's username. Once clicked, its sub menu appears with links to edit
information about the user: personal details, address, and password.

The User Information page is used to change personal and contact details about
the current user: title, given names, surname, display name, email and phone.

The Change Password requires the user to enter his/her current password as well
as the new password twice to ensure that there are no mistakes.

Details about the current user's address can be changed in the Edit Address
link.

Next are links to the Device, Premise, Health, and Security Overview pages.
After those are two menu entries with sub menus, Activity Logs, and Settings.
The sub menu for the Activity Log has three links, premise log, device log, and
user log. The sub menu for the Settings has two categories: Premise and Rooms,
and Devices.

At the bottom of the main menu is a button called "Switch Users". Pressing it
will take you to a page to enter the username and password. It looks and works
like the main login page. Switching users, will end the current session.

-----2.1: Device Overview-------------------------------------------------------
This is the first page that will be displayed once logged in to the program. On
this page is a list of every device that the current user can access regardless
of the location of each device.

----------2.1.1: Types of Devices-----------------------------------------------
First, a list of regular devices is shown. These devices are attached to a wide
variety of pathways (devices that connect to a Comms).

----------2.1.2: Specialised Devices--------------------------------------------
There may be certain devices in the list that perform specific functions. These
can be for health or security.

---------------2.1.2.1: Health--------------------------------------------------
Health devices measure bodily functions (e.g. heartbeat, respiration, blood
pressure, etc.).

There is a separate page for listing only health devices (Health Overview). The 
health page will read blood pressure, heart beat, and respiratory rate data from
any connected health monitoring device. The data gathered is represented in a
line graph with the average heart rate and respiratory rate listed below.

---------------2.1.2.2: Security------------------------------------------------
These devices can include IP Cameras and motion sensors.

Each entry in the security list shows the name the camera is referred to. This
is a link to its information page. This page displays the camera stream if the
camera is on, its activity log, and controls to record the stream or to capture
a screenshot of the stream or to enable/disable the motion sensor.

A separate page lists all IP Cameras and motion sensors in each room. Rooms with
no cameras are not listed.

-----2.2: Premise Overview------------------------------------------------------
There is a combo box with a list of available premises that the user has access
to. Below that is a list of room the premise has with devices attached. Each
item displays number of devices attached to the room, the name of the room in
the centre (a link to edit the room), and to the right a button to expand its
device list.

A room is only listed on this page when there are devices attached to it. For a
full list of rooms see the premise and rooms settings page.

It has an extras menu that contains links to add a new room, edit the address
and information of the currently selected premise.

----------2.2.1: Device List----------------------------------------------------
Once the button on the right of the room name is clicked, a list of device names
is either shown or hidden. By tapping a device name, the user is taken to a page
that shows all the data gathered from the device's sensors (volt, amp, kiloWatts
and kiloWatts/hour).

----------2.2.2: Room Overview--------------------------------------------------
This page lists all the devices associated with the currently selected room and
their sensors (eg. volt, amp, kiloWatts and kiloWatts/hour) with their values.
You can also turn a device on or off.

Its extras menu has the option to edit the currently selected room.

----------2.2.3: Editing a Room-------------------------------------------------
Clicking on the room name will lead to the edit room page. Here you can change
the name of the room, its description, and the type of room it's classified as.

In this page there is a button to delete the currently selected room.

----------2.2.4: Adding a Room--------------------------------------------------
This page is similar to the edit room page. It adds instead of edits, and has no
delete button.

-----2.3: Activity Log----------------------------------------------------------
The activity log is separated into three categories: premise, user and device.
Each is its own link.

----------2.3.1: Premise Log----------------------------------------------------
All activity on every accessible premise for the current user is listed here.

----------2.3.2: User Log-------------------------------------------------------
User account activity is recorded and shown on this page.

----------2.3.3: Device Log-----------------------------------------------------
All activity on all accessible devices is logged here.

-----2.4: Settings--------------------------------------------------------------
There are two main categories of settings: devices, and premises and rooms.

----------2.4.1: Link List------------------------------------------------------
The link list is simply a list of links and their objects. Each object is shown
under its link. Every link and object button will direct the user to their
respective editing pages.

----------2.4.2: Premise List---------------------------------------------------
The premise list lists all the premises that the users have access to. There are
two columns, number of hubs attached on the left and the name of the premise to
the right. The premise name is a link to a page that will show information
relating to the selected premise. If the current user has permission to edit the
details of the premise, then it the page will have a form with editable fields.
Otherwise the page will simply list the details in a similar fashion to the edit
page.

The edit page will also have an extras menu with the option to edit the address
of the current premise and, if the current user has permission to do so, another
button to edit premise permissions.
